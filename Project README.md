I needed to create a password for the user to be able to generate at random. I took into consideration at what the client needed. I came up with this pseudo code in order to figure out what the client needed
  //need to generate a random number based on the length of an array.
  //Need to make several arrays with lowercase and upper case letters, numbers, special characters
  //Need to create an empty array thats chosen values in an array. 
  //How to add to an array let chosenValues = [...upper];
  //use a nested if statements to add to chosenValues
  //Math.floor(Math.random()*chosenValues.lenth)
  //emptyArray needs to add chosenValues[Random number]
  //use .push to add to password 
  //password.join(""); adds to empty string
  // use for loop around repeated steps. 
  //need to return a string return "password";

  With this i was able to generate my javascript and created 6 arrays. 4 of which that were filled up identifiers to possibly be used in password combinations

  After this i created window prompts for the user to generate there password based on any requirements they may need/want. 
  I used if statements in combination with window confirm's in order to see what the user wanted to input.
  Then i passed the length the user specified through a for loop and generated there password
  finally i returned joining the password to the write password funtion to get it to display in the box. 

  Thank you for reading through my walk through on how i created this code!
